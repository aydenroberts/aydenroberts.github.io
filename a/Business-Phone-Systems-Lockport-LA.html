<p>Still, with so much option readily available, and with so much lingo surrounding the topic of office telephones, it can be hard to understand where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are convenient and practical; they're not mobile. However, if your business should abide by security policies that require data to be stored on-site, then a hosted option is most likely not the best service.
