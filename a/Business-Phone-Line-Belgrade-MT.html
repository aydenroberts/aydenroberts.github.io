<p>Still, with so much choice readily available, and with so much lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be difficult to know where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and hassle-free; they're not mobile. However, if your business needs to comply with security regulations that need data to be saved on-site, then a hosted option is most likely not the best option. The only distinction between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost of today's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the traditional phone networks (the traditional phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>
