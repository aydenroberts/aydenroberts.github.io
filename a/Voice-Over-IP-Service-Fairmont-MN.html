<p>Moving workplaces? Smart Office USA is happy to partner with Star2Star to provide you feature-rich phone systems that link your core business systems to your interactions to drive much better productivity throughout your whole company. So if you wish to purchase a new business telephone system for your established company or start-up, ALINK is the relied on, professional company you have actually been trying to find. These phones include physical features such as a speakerphone or microphone, a touchpad, and display hardware to reveal user input and caller ID.
