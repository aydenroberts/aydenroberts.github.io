<p>Still, with a lot choice available, and with so much lingo surrounding the subject of office telephones, it can be difficult to know where to start. While Digital Phone Systems are practical and useful; they're not mobile. However, if your business should adhere to security regulations that require data to be stored on-site, then a hosted option is most likely not the very best option. The only difference in between Centrex and today's hosted phone systems (besides the lower cost these days's hosted systems) is that the Centrex systems ran over the conventional phone networks (the standard phone lines) instead of the Internet (as holds true with a hosted VoIP system today).</p>

This makes VoIP the ideal option for multi-site businesses or organisations that make ready usage of their phones.
