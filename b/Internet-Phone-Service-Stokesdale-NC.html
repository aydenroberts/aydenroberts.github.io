<p>VoIP uses your local area network and the Internet for phone calls, rather of traditional phone lines. Car Attendant: this function includes familiar features to your office phone system like extension and voicemail transfer, touch-tone, and messaging options. These features allow voicemails to be sent to emails and computers to be turned into phones. And how good is the cabling on premise and LAN infrastructure (routers, switches, etc.).
